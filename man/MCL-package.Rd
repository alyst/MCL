Markov Cluster Algorithm
}
\description{
Contains the Markov cluster algorithm (MCL) by van Dongen (2000) for identifying clusters in networks and graphs. The algorithm simulates random walks on a (n x n) matrix as the adjacency matrix of a graph. It alternates an expansion step and an inflation step until an equilibrium state is reached.

The Markov Cluster Algorithm (MCL) is a method to identify clusters in undirected network graphs. It is suitable for high-dimensional data (e.g. gene expression data). 

The original MCL uses the adjacency matrix of a graph (propsed by van Dongen (2000)). The function \code{mcl} in this package allows in addition the input of a (n x n) matrix.

### Load adjacency matrix
adjacency <- matrix(c(0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,
             0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,
             0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
             0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0), byrow=TRUE, nrow=9)

### Run MCL 
mcl(x = adjacency, addLoops = TRUE )
